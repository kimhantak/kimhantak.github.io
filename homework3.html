                <h3>Stanford researchers find a quicker,<br>cheaper way to sort isotopes.</h3>
                <p>
                    BY EMMANUEL ROMERO L.A. Cicero Richard Zare 
                    professor Richard Zare in his lab. Whether it's the summer
                    grass that tickles your feet or the red Bordeaux smacking on
                    your palate, nearly every part of the world around you carries
                    special chemical markers. These markers, called isotopes, can
                    tell scientists where the molecules that compose a subtance
                    are from, where they traveled and what happened to them
                    along the way. But doing these analyses has been complex
                    and costly. Now, Stanford chemists have developed a new
                    method to make isotopic analysis easier and less expensive.

                <h3>Chance to dance: Enthusiasts fly to<br>Stanford for dance weekend</h3>
                <p>
                    BY CYNTHIA HAVEN L.A. Cicero Lindy Hop instruction
                    Stanford is an epcenter for the vintage dance movement--but
                    life in the Stanford dance world is not all foxrots and tangos.
                    The June 26-28 Stanford's Dance Weekend in Robie Gym
                    offers something for modern dance enthusiasts, too the
                    hustle, the West Coast swing, 1970s disco hustle, Bollywood and blues fusion.
